# Crowd Funding Outcomes

The objective of this project was to find trends in regards to companies that were successful and were crowdsourced.

Conditional Formatting was created for columns reflecting outcomes and percent funded.

Among the sub-categories, plays stood out as the most successful but also the most failed and the most canceled.  Pivot tables and stacked column charts were created to visually demonstrate success, failure and cancel rates.  Additionally, the stacked column pivot chart can be filtered by country in order to see better results.


Analysis

Conclusions
• Successful campaigns were funded at or above their goal amount.  Campaigns that were most successfully funded (100%) fell within the monetary goal of 15000 to 34999.  Goals set less than 1000 were more successful and had few failures, whereas goals set greater than 50000 were less successful and had more failures.  
•	Summer months tended to trend more successful campaigns than winter months.  A conclusion could be that individuals were more likely to partake in the activity involved in the campaign during those months, rather than winter when outdoor time was limited.
