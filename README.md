## Conclusions

• Successful campaigns were funded at or above their goal amount.  Campaigns that were most successfully funded (100%) fell within the monetary goal of 15000 to 34999.  Goals set less than 1000 were more successful and had few failures, whereas goals set greater than 50000 were less successful and had more failures.  
•	Summer months tended to trend more successful campaigns than winter months.  A conclusion could be that individuals were more likely to partake in the activity involved in the campaign during those months, rather than winter when outdoor time was limited.
